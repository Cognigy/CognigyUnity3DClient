# CognigyUnity3DClient

*Created and tested with Unity 3D 2018.1.3f1*

  ## - Important -
The current version (2.0.0) and all the following versions of this client will connect to the COGNIGY.AI version 3.0+, which causes some fundamental changes in the manner the connection is built up. The consequence is that you cannot connect with an older version (below 2.0.0) of this client to COGNIGY.AI 3.0 resources and you cannot connect with versions older than 2.0.0 of this plugin to COGNIGY.AI below version 3.0.
